## My Interests

Hey! I'm currently studying Web Design and UX Design. When I’m not working on creative projects, I love:

- Listening to music (especially metal and alternative rock 🤘)
- Hanging out with my friends and having good times
- Exploring nature and seeing cool, beautiful places 🌲🌄
- Spending time with cats — they're the best companions 🐱

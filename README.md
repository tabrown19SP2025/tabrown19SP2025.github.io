# About Me

## My Interests

Hey! I'm currently studying Web Design and UX Design. When I’m not working on creative projects, I love:

- Listening to music (especially metal and alternative rock )
- Hanging out with my friends and having good times
- Exploring nature and seeing cool, beautiful places 
- Spending time with cats — they're the best companions 

## Websites I Recommend

- [The Catnip Times](https://www.thecatniptimes.com) – A fun and informative website full of cat news, tips, and product reviews for cat lovers.
- [Cole & Marmalade](https://coleandmarmalade.com) – This site follows two rescue cats and shares adorable stories, helpful info about cat care, and cute videos.
